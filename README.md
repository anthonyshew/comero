# Welcome to the demo of Comero.
> The fastest, most customizable, and easiest to use restaurant website builder ever.

The front-end of the website is viewable <a href="https://comero-demo.netlify.app" target="_blank">here.</a>

To take a look at the CMS, you will need to sign into the content editor. I ask that you please do not make any changes to the demo site once you have logged in (so I can keep my demo nice and pretty how I like it). To log in:
1. <a href="https://comero-demo.netlify.app" target="_blank">Open the editor by clicking here</a> or visiting `https://comero-demo.netlify.app/admin`.
2. Signing in with Google will let you in with two clicks. If you choose to create an account, you will need to verify your e-mail address before logging in.
3. I know I said it before but it's worth saying again. I'd like to keep my demo looking how I have it so please do not update the CMS in any way, shape, or form. Please. I'm trusting you. :)
