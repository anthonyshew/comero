  "restaurantAbout": "House Divided Brewery is a local brewery in Ely, Iowa! \n\nHouse Divided Brewery was created when Cal and Lisa Corrin took this picture for their 2013 Christmas card. Cal had been homebrewing for a few years and decided to use the name for his homebrewery. When the opportunity presented itself to open this nanobrewery, there was a debate on the name for the brewery. It was finally decided to keep the same name that had been used for several years -\n\nHOUSE DIVIDED BREWERY\n",
